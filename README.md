# mitxpro-eye-exercise

## Description

The eye movement exercise is a showcase of using CSS as a drawing tool in conjunction with JS to make the drawings move. The position of the pupil inside the eyeball is drawn toward the user's mouse via javascript.


## How to Run

* In the top-right-hand corner, click the green dropdown menu and download this folder as a zip or clone the repository
* open index.html in your preffered browser
* move your mouse around to watch the eyes move

## Roadmap of Future Improvements

* spawn additional eyeball at click location
